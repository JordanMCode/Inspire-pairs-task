        <h3>Set up in 2012 Inspire Norfolk supports businesses to recruit apprentices</h3>
        <p>We really de-mystify the process by identifying suitable roles within your team, creating job descriptions, locating appropriate training providers and sourcing funding.</p>
        <p>We are there for a business every step of the way right up to the time they appoint a successful candidate and beyond. Our aim is that all the apprentices we place will eventually move into a full time position within the company once their apprenticeship is complete.</p>
        <p>We also work with young people themselves, mainly those who are struggling, for a variety of reasons, to find work. We will take time to get to know them and discuss their goals, likes and dislikes and create a bespoke package of support to ensure they find the right opportunity to ensure they have a positive experience and move into an appropriate apprenticeship.</p>
